# Create an empty stack
stack = []

# Push items onto the stack
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)

# Pop items off the stack

                            # In this example, we create an empty list and use
                            # the append() method toadd items onto the stack.
                            # We then use the pop() method to remove items
                            # from the stack in last-in, first-out (LIFO)
                            # order. The output of the pop()method is the
                            # last item that was added to the stack
